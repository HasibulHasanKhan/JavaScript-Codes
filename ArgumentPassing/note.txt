üìå Pass by Value vs Pass by Reference in JavaScript
Understanding pass by value and pass by reference is crucial when working with variables, functions, and memory in JavaScript.

üî• 1. What is Pass by Value?
When a primitive data type (like Number, String, Boolean, etc.) is passed to a function, a copy of the value is created.
Any modifications inside the function do not affect the original value.
‚úÖ Example of Pass by Value
javascript
Copy
Edit
function updateValue(x) {
  x = 20; // Changes the local copy
  console.log("Inside function:", x);
}

let a = 10;
updateValue(a);
console.log("Outside function:", a); // Original value remains unchanged
üîπ Output:

bash
Copy
Edit
Inside function: 20
Outside function: 10
üìå Explanation:

a is a primitive (Number), so its copy is passed to the function.
The function modifies the copy, but a outside the function remains unchanged.
üî• 2. What is Pass by Reference?
When a non-primitive data type (like Array, Object, Function) is passed to a function, a reference (memory address) to the original object is passed.
Any modifications inside the function affect the original object.
‚úÖ Example of Pass by Reference
javascript
Copy
Edit
function updateObject(obj) {
  obj.name = "Updated Name"; // Modifies the original object
}

let person = { name: "John" };
updateObject(person);
console.log(person.name); // "Updated Name"
üîπ Output:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Updated Name
üìå Explanation:

person is an object (non-primitive).
Instead of passing a copy, JavaScript passes a reference (memory address).
Any changes made inside the function directly modify the original object.
üî• 3. Key Differences Between Pass by Value and Pass by Reference
Feature	Pass by Value	Pass by Reference
Data Type	Primitives (Number, String, Boolean, etc.)	Non-Primitives (Array, Object, Function)
What is Passed?	A copy of the value	A reference (memory address)
Modification Inside Function	Does NOT affect the original value	Affects the original object
Memory Allocation	Separate memory for each copy	Same memory shared via reference
üî• 4. Special Case: Changing the Reference vs. Changing the Object
There is an important distinction between:

Modifying the properties of an object (affects the original object).
Reassigning the reference (does NOT affect the original object).
‚úÖ Example of Modifying an Object (Changes Original)
javascript
Copy
Edit
function modifyObject(obj) {
  obj.age = 30; // Modifies original
}

let user = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
modifyObject(user);
console.log(user.age); // 30
üìå Explanation: The function changes the age property, which affects the original object.

‚úÖ Example of Reassigning the Reference (Does NOT Change Original)
javascript
Copy
Edit
function reassignObject(obj) {
  obj = { name: "New User", age: 40 }; // Creates a new object, does NOT affect the original
}

let user = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
reassignObject(user);
console.log(user.age); // 25
üìå Explanation:

Inside the function, obj is reassigned to a new object.
However, this does not modify the original user object.
üî• 5. Pass by Value and Pass by Reference with Arrays
‚úÖ Arrays are Passed by Reference
javascript
Copy
Edit
function modifyArray(arr) {
  arr.push(4); // Modifies the original array
}

let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
modifyArray(numbers);
console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
üìå Explanation:

Since arrays are objects, their reference is passed.
Changes inside the function affect the original array.
üî• 6. How to Avoid Unintended Changes with Pass by Reference?
If you want to prevent modifying the original object or array:

Use the Spread Operator (...) to create a copy.
Use Object.assign() for shallow copies.
Use JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)) for deep copies.
‚úÖ Using the Spread Operator
javascript
Copy
Edit
function modifyArray(arr) {
  let newArr = [...arr]; // Creates a copy
  newArr.push(4);
  console.log("Inside function:", newArr);
}

let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
modifyArray(numbers);
console.log("Outside function:", numbers); // Original remains unchanged
üöÄ Final Summary
Feature	Pass by Value	Pass by Reference
Data Type	Primitives (Number, String, Boolean, etc.)	Non-Primitives (Array, Object, Function)
What is Passed?	A copy of the value	A reference (memory address)
Modification Inside Function	Does NOT affect the original value	Affects the original object
Arrays & Objects	‚ùå Not passed by value	‚úÖ Passed by reference

You said:
function reassignObject(obj) {
  obj = { name: "New User", age: 40 }; // Creates a new object, does NOT affect the original
}

let user = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
reassignObject(user);
console.log(user.age); // 25

üìå Why Reassigning an Object Inside a Function Doesn't Affect the Original?
When you pass an object to a function, JavaScript passes its reference (i.e., the memory address). However, if you reassign the parameter inside the function, it points to a new object in memory, leaving the original object unchanged.

Let‚Äôs break this down visually and conceptually:

Step-by-Step Execution üõ†Ô∏è
1Ô∏è‚É£ Memory Before Function Call
javascript
Copy
Edit
let user = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
user is created in memory at an address (e.g., 0xABC).
user stores the reference to this memory.
Visual Representation
pgsql
Copy
Edit
Memory Address  |  Value
----------------|---------------------
0xABC           |  { name: "Alice", age: 25 }
Variable user holds a reference (0xABC) to this object.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Function Call
javascript
Copy
Edit
reassignObject(user);
user (which stores 0xABC) is passed to the function.
Inside the function, obj now holds the same reference (0xABC).
rust
Copy
Edit
obj (inside function) ---> 0xABC  --->  { name: "Alice", age: 25 }
3Ô∏è‚É£ Inside the Function (Before Reassignment)
javascript
Copy
Edit
obj = { name: "New User", age: 40 };
Here, a new object { name: "New User", age: 40 } is created at a new memory location (e.g., 0xDEF).
The local variable obj is now updated to point to 0xDEF.
But user outside the function still points to 0xABC.
rust
Copy
Edit
obj (inside function) ---> 0xDEF  --->  { name: "New User", age: 40 }
user (outside function) ---> 0xABC  --->  { name: "Alice", age: 25 }
üìå Key Observation: The original user still points to 0xABC, so it remains unchanged.

4Ô∏è‚É£ After Function Execution
The function ends, and obj is discarded.
user is still pointing to 0xABC, meaning its value remains unchanged.
javascript
Copy
Edit
console.log(user.age); // 25 (Original object is unchanged)
Final Memory State
pgsql
Copy
Edit
Memory Address  |  Value
----------------|---------------------
0xABC           |  { name: "Alice", age: 25 }  <-- user still refers to this
0xDEF           |  { name: "New User", age: 40 }  <-- obj pointed here temporarily
üìù Key Takeaways
Passing objects to a function passes the reference (memory address), NOT the actual object.
Modifying the properties of an object inside the function will change the original.
But reassigning the parameter (obj = { ... }) creates a new object and does NOT affect the original.
Once the function exits, the local obj is discarded, and user remains unchanged.
‚úÖ How to Modify the Original Object Instead?
If you want to change the original object, modify its properties instead of reassigning:

javascript
Copy
Edit
function modifyObject(obj) {
  obj.name = "New User"; // Modifies the original object
}

let user = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
modifyObject(user);
console.log(user.name); // "New User" ‚úÖ
‚úÖ This works because we are modifying properties instead of reassigning the reference.
