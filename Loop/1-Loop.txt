In JavaScript, there are multiple types of loops that allow you to iterate over data structures, execute code repeatedly, and automate tasks efficiently. Below is a detailed explanation of each loop type with examples.

1. for Loop
The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.

Syntax:
javascript
Copy
Edit
for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to be executed
}
Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log("Iteration:", i);
}
Output:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Iteration: 0
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Iteration: 3
Iteration: 4
2. while Loop
The while loop executes as long as the condition remains true.

Syntax:
javascript
Copy
Edit
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}
Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log("Count:", i);
    i++;
}
Output:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Count: 0
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
3. do-while Loop
The do-while loop executes the code block at least once before checking the condition.

Syntax:
javascript
Copy
Edit
do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
let i = 0;
do {
    console.log("Number:", i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
Output:

javascript
Copy
Edit
Number: 0
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
4. for-in Loop (Used for Objects)
The for-in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object.

Syntax:
javascript
Copy
Edit
for (let key in object) {
    // Code to be executed
}
Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
let person = { name: "John", age: 25, city: "New York" };

for (let key in person) {
    console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
}
Output:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
name: John
age: 25
city: New York
5. for-of Loop (Used for Iterables like Arrays, Strings, Sets, Maps)
The for-of loop iterates over iterable objects like arrays, strings, etc.

Syntax:
javascript
Copy
Edit
for (let item of iterable) {
    // Code to be executed
}
Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40];

for (let num of numbers) {
    console.log(num);
}
Output:

Copy
Edit
10
20
30
40
6. forEach (Array Method)
The forEach loop is specifically for arrays and executes a function on each element.

Syntax:
javascript
Copy
Edit
array.forEach((value, index, array) => {
    // Code to be executed
});
Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"];

fruits.forEach((fruit, index) => {
    console.log(index + ": " + fruit);
});
Output:

makefile
Copy
Edit
0: Apple
1: Banana
2: Mango
7. map (Returns a New Array)
The map method transforms each element in an array and returns a new array.

Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

let squares = numbers.map(num => num * num);
console.log(squares);
Output:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[1, 4, 9, 16]
8. break and continue in Loops
break: Exits the loop entirely.
continue: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
Example with break:
javascript
Copy
Edit
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i === 3) break;
    console.log(i);
}
Output:

Copy
Edit
0
1
2
Example with continue:
javascript
Copy
Edit
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i === 3) continue;
    console.log(i);
}
Output:

Copy
Edit
0
1
2
4
Summary of When to Use Each Loop:
Loop Type	When to Use
for loop	When you know the number of iterations.
while loop	When the loop should continue until a condition is met.
do-while loop	When you need the loop to execute at least once.
for-in loop	When iterating over object properties.
for-of loop	When iterating over arrays, strings, or other iterable structures.
forEach	When working with arrays and executing a function for each element.
map	When transforming an array into a new array.
